  <p class="my-story-desc">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  From the moment I first opened a graphics editor as a teenager, I was captivated by the power of design to communicate, inspire, and solve real-world problems. Over the past 17 years, I’ve transformed that curiosity into a career—working at the intersection of product design and full stack development.

    <p class="my-story-desc">
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My journey began with branding projects for local startups, where I learned the importance of crafting visual identities that truly resonate. As my skills grew, so did my ambition. I dove into user experience, building intuitive interfaces and seamless digital products that put people first. Every project-whether a server dashboard for a tech company or a vibrant e-commerce site for a fitness brand—has been an opportunity to blend creativity with functionality.</p>
   <p class="my-story-desc">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What drives me is the challenge of turning complex ideas into simple, elegant solutions. I believe that the best products are born from empathy, collaboration, and a relentless attention to detail. My approach is hands-on and holistic: I love sketching wireframes, prototyping interactions, and writing clean, scalable code.</p>
   <p class="my-story-desc">
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, I work with clients across New York and beyond, helping them bring their visions to life. Whether you’re a startup looking to make your mark or an established brand aiming to innovate, I’m here to help you create something remarkable.

Let’s build the future, one pixel at a time.
